/**
 * Publishes generated previews of each widget to the system widget picker.
 *
 * Two platform constraints shape this. Generated previews exist only on Android 15 and
 * later, and `GlanceAppWidgetManager.setWidgetPreviews` does not check the running SDK
 * itself, so the caller must. Publishing is also rate limited to roughly two calls an
 * hour for the whole app, while there are five widgets to publish.
 *
 * Together those rule out a single app-wide "already published" flag: one throttled widget
 * would hold the flag back, and the next launch would spend the fresh quota re-publishing
 * widgets that had already succeeded, so the widgets at the end of the list might never
 * get a preview at all. Instead each widget records its own [publishStamp], advanced only
 * after its own call succeeds, and a throttled call ends the run so the remaining quota is
 * left for the next launch.
