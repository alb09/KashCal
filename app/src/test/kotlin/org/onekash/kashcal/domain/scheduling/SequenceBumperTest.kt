/**
 * Tests [SequenceBumper], the source of truth for when an organizer edit bumps the iCalendar
 * SEQUENCE (RFC 5546 §2.1.4).
 *
 * Bump: DTSTART, DTEND, DURATION, the all-day flag, RRULE (compared by meaning), RDATE, EXDATE, a
 * transition of STATUS to CANCELLED, and the attendee-facing SUMMARY and LOCATION (compared
 * trimmed). Cosmetic properties (DESCRIPTION, CATEGORIES, COLOR) must not bump: they don't
 * invalidate an attendee's prior acceptance, so a higher SEQUENCE would re-notify attendees for
 * nothing. Also tests [SequenceBumper.nextSequence].
